        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>I love every facet of the web, and love exploring new ways to secure and connect endpoints. 
            I've managed web applications at every layer, and I've gained a deeper understanding of networking and developing in new and exciting ways. I currently work as a Cybersecurity Engineer for Great Wolf Lodge, while concurrently wrapping up my B.S. in Computer Science in the Fall of 2024,
        at CSU Monterey Bay. </p>

    <br>
    <p> Outside of school and work I try and spend as much time as I can outdoors to recharge, and I'm lucky enough to live on the Central Coast of California in on of the most beautiful cities in the Country!</p>
